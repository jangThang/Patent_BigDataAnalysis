## About Repository
<!--Wirte one paragraph of project description -->  
The project extracts patent search formulas and technical classifications through natural language processing.

## Overview
<!-- Write Overview about this project -->
&nbsp; **South of Korea** ranks first in the world for patent applications as a percentage of GDP-population, and the number of individual patent applications has increased sixfold compared to 2002. 'patent application' means applying to register a patent.

&nbsp; **However, nearly 90% of individual patent applicants are rejected due to 'similar patents'**, and most patents are registered by an 'agent (patent attorney)' on their behalf.

&nbsp; Therefore, the project conducted patent analysis using natural language processing so that individual patent applicants could do patent analysis without having to resort to expensive 'patent offices'.
